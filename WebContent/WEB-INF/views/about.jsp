				"The best way to describe the reason for my choice to become a
				Software Developer is best summed up through a story from my past.
				When I was a child, about the age of 5. I sat on the porch one day
				and I felt the wind blow and I seen the trees moving in the wind. It
				really got me thinking "What makes the wind?". I pondered maybe the
				trees are making it? But then I realized they were merely being
				moved by the wind. So I thought more and came to the only conclusion
				that could make sense at that time (I still think it's a good
				theory!). Maybe the wind is made by everyone on the earth breathing
				at the same time!!! Okay, so how does that story sum up why this is
				was my career choice? Well, this has always been my thought process.
				I have always been extremely curious how things work and have always
				dove deep into thought to figure out solutions. Which is exactly
				what is needed as a Software Developer!"<br /> <em><strong><a

				"I've been fascinated by the inner workings of tech from an early
				age. Building computers and designing websites have been my passions
				for years. Now, with the ability to add interactive elements and
				java logic, the experiences I create can be that much better. Play
				RTD has been a great opportunity to stretch my front end skills and
				to employ powerful APIs, bringing a wealth of content to the user."
